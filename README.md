# Portfolio Layout Project

### Introduction

This week, we'll be working extensively to sharpen our layout skills. The basic layouts should be the desktop and mobile layouts pictured below (along with some pop culture grades for the weekend):

### How do the contents of these two layouts relate to each other?

* The nav sidebar on the desktop layout should collapse to abbreviated words or icons in the subheader of the mobile layout.
* The login/signup link should be a [generic user profile icon](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=profile+icon&t=canonical&atb=v165-1&ia=images&iax=images) in the mobile layout.
* The main content should be in two or more columns in the desktop, then should collapse to one in the mobile layout.


### What should my content be?

I would recommend you make your portfolio follow this classic layout. If you want to make a copy of the portfolio repo and apply these layouts to that copy, feel free. You could also apply your layouts to new content or some lorem ipsum. The power is yours.

### Stretch goals!
