# Portfolio Layout Project

### Introduction

This week, we'll be working extensively to sharpen our layout skills. The basic layouts should be the desktop and mobile layouts pictured below (along with some pop culture grades for the weekend):

### How do the contents of these two layouts relate to each other?

* The nav sidebar on the desktop layout should collapse to abbreviated words or icons in the subheader of the mobile layout.
* The login/signup link should be a [generic user profile icon](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=profile+icon&t=canonical&atb=v165-1&ia=images&iax=images) in the mobile layout.
* The main content should be in two or more columns in the desktop, then should collapse to one in the mobile layout.


### What should my content be?

I would recommend you make your portfolio follow this classic layout. If you want to make a copy of the portfolio repo and apply these layouts to that copy, feel free. You could also apply your layouts to new content or some lorem ipsum. The power is yours.


### Stretch goals!

* Make the navbar float with the view in desktop view. In other words, when we scroll down the page, our title bar should get scrolled past, but the navbar would stay on the side, with our links viisble, no matter how far we scroll.
* Make the navbar a (floating) hamburger menu for the mobile view.
* make login/signup drop-down that tabs between login and signup
* make login (whether checking pw or not) unlock a feature... appearance of button for admin page, an admin page that won't load unless they're logged in
* make pw-checking backend, store new username/pw for signup or check current pw against username for login
